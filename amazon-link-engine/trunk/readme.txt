Automatically localize and affiliate Amazon product links to improve user experience, increase conversions and earn global commissions.


== Description ==

Boost sales and affiliate commissions by converting all your Amazon links into localized links that bring each shopper to the best Amazon store and product for their region in the world. Amazon Link Engine is trusted by thousands of Amazon associates who have been using it to maximize their revenue for years.

The Amazon Link Engine is a tool by Geniuslink. By signing up for Geniuslink and syncing the Amazon Link Engine to your Geniuslink account, you can also attach your Associates IDs to earn international affiliate commissions from your traffic.

*Note:* You are not required to have a Geniuslink account, to use this plugin. However, if you would like to earn international affiliate commissions, you must sign up for a Geniuslink Account. [Try it out for free](http://social.geni.us/ALESignup) and check out pricing for the Geniuslink service on [our website](http://social.geni.us/lZlZ8AY).

= How does the Amazon Link Engine plugin work? =

As soon as the plugin is installed, your Amazon links are instantly localized every time a user loads the page.  Even if you add new links to your WordPress site, each will be automatically converted without any additional work from you. Nothing else is needed on your part.

= How do I earn international commissions from my links? =

To earn international affiliate commissions, you must [create a Geniuslink account](http://social.geni.us/ALESignup), and connect it to your plugin with your API keys (detailed instructions can be found in the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-link-engine/faq/)).

Once signed up, add and manage your Associates IDs for each of the Amazon affiliate programs you’ve signed up for within the Geniuslink Dashboard. Once your IDs are added, the Amazon Link Engine will automatically add the correct Associates ID per country for each click.

* *Note:* The Amazon Link Engine WordPress plugin is free to use and will always localize your links without a paid account. However, in order to earn international affiliate commissions and take advantage of the in-depth reporting, **you must have a Geniuslink account**. By default, Geniuslink’s Associates IDs will be used until you have connected your account and added your own via the Geniuslink Dashboard.

= How is Geniuslink different? =

Most link "localization" plugins only translate a link for an international click when the same product ID exists in both storefronts. However, oftentimes the same item in different storefronts has a completely different product ID, and even if the ID is the same, the product may be an overpriced "import" item or may never be in stock. The Amazon Link Engine and Geniuslink match on more than just the product ID to ensure every click gets to the best possible destination. So instead of sending your users to blank search results, we guarantee the best possible user experience.

In addition, connecting your Geniuslink account to the Amazon Link Engine, gives you access to comprehensive reporting on clicks and commissions that no other plugin can offer. These reports allow you to review your link’s performance across many metrics including product type, referrer, browser, device, operating system, destination storefront, and geography.


= Is it safe to use this plugin and Geniuslink with the Amazon Associates program? =
Yes!

Geniuslink is safe to use with the Amazon Associate program, and has been trusted by thousands of Amazon associates for years.

Just be sure to follow the [program guidelines](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/policies#Associates%20Program%20Participation%20Requirements) and do not use your links to deceive your visitors.

Note that you can also enable our "on-click" method in the plugin advanced settings, which preserves your raw Amazon links until the moment they are clicked.  Some users prefer this method because the Amazon Associates Program has additional guidelines for using "short links", and by using this option your links are shown in their original form.




= Key Features: =

* Pick which Geniuslink group this plugin syncs to. Setup the plugin on multiple WordPress sites and track clicks separately, or set up a specific group just for your WordPress site traffic. Instructions can be found under “How do I change the default group?” in the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-link-engine/faq/)
* Already have Affiliated links on your site? The ALE will now honor these existing Associates IDs within your links. You can also choose to overwrite them with the ID within your Geniuslink account if you prefer. Learn more under “Will the ALE honor existing Associates IDs?” in the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-link-engine/faq/)
* Automatic localization and translation of all Amazon product links based off a visitor’s location.
* Maximize revenue by earning commissions from all of the Amazon Associates programs.
* Brand your globalized links with your own custom domain. (Note: this requires a paid [Geniuslink Account](http://social.geni.us/lZlZ8AY))
* Simple, easy setup.
* One time configuration. Simply install the plugin, set up your Geniuslink account, and connect the two with an API key.  We take care of the rest.
* No need to sign up for an Amazon Developer account or apply for any of Amazon’s APIs or web tools.
* Your workflow remains the same.  No need to learn a new linking syntax, or disrupt your current flow.

= What makes the Amazon Link Engine different from other Affiliate WP plugins? =
* Most plugins for Amazon links simply try to match based on ASIN (product ID) across foreign storefronts. The Amazon Link Engine uses a patented algorithm to get your users to the best possible destination.
* This in turn helps to both increase conversions and commissions, as well as improve the user experience for your audience.
* Unrivaled support from the Geniuslink team.
* No need to build links manually with a special link format.  All of your Amazon links are automatically converted to localized links when the page loads.

= Do I have to pay for Geniuslink? =

However, if you would like access to advanced reporting features, a custom domain, or the ability to add your international Associates IDs, you will need to sign up for a Geniuslink account.  [Try it out for free](http://social.geni.us/ALESignup). Learn more about our [fair and transparent pricing](http://social.geni.us/ALEPricing).

Please note: By default, Geniuslink's international Associates IDs will be used until you have added your own via the Geniuslink dashboard.  Please [contact Geniuslink](mailto:hi@geni.us) if you have any questions.



= How do I earn International Commissions? =

First, connect the plugin to your Geniuslink account (see "How do I get my API keys?"). Then, follow the steps below:

1. Add your Amazon Associates IDs to your Geniuslink dashboard. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](http://help.geni.us/support/solutions/articles/3000028199-amazon-associates-program-guide).
*Note:* If you’ve already done this within your existing Geniuslink account, you do not need to add your IDs again.
1. You’re all set! You’ll start earning international commissions from anything purchased in Amazon’s international storefronts.

**Please Note:** You must [sign up for a Geniuslink account](http://social.geni.us/ALESignup) and add your Associates IDs to the dashboard to earn international affiliate commissions.  Once you have done this, and connected your account using the API keys, each of your links will be automatically affiliated.

= How do I change the default group? =
In order to change the group that the plugin syncs with, you must first connect your Geniuslink account using your API keys. Once you have done this, you can simply select the group you would like to use from the drop down menu under “Using Link Group” in the Amazon Link Engine Settings. If you leave this blank, the “Default” group in your Geniuslink Account will be used.

= Will the ALE honor existing Associates IDs? =
Yes. By default, the ALE will honor any existing Associates IDs that are already added to the link.

* This will ensure that you still earn the affiliate commissions you deserve on your existing affiliate links within your site. In addition, this is great for blogs that have multiple editors with multiple Amazon Associates IDs to keep track of clicks, commissions, etc. per editor. By selecting this option the ALE will honor any existing Associates IDs already within links on the site, ensuring those editors continue to get the credit they deserve for helping you earn those affiliate commissions.

* If you would like to toggle this on or off, simply uncheck the “Honor Existing Associate IDs” checkbox in the Amazon Link Engine settings under "Advanced Settings".

= Is the Amazon Link Engine compatible with other affiliate tools? =

* **iTunes Link Engine:**
The Amazon Link Engine is fully compatible with the iTunes Link Engine plugin.

* **Skimlinks:**
The Amazon Link Engine plugin works perfectly with Skimlinks.

* **VigLink:**
The VigLink plugin, however, will overwrite the ALE and not allow your links to be globalized if it has already been installed. If you are currently using this plugin, you simply need to deactivate it from your Wordpress site, download and activate the Amazon Link Engine plugin, and then reactivate the Viglink plugin.  Once this is done, the plugins will work seamlessly together.

* **Amazon Publisher Studio:**
The Amazon Publisher Studio tool is unfortunately not compatible with this version of the ALE plugin.



== Screenshots ==

1. **Amazon Link Engine Interface.**
1. **Before:** You have links to an item within a single Amazon storefront. 
1. **After:** When you install the Amazon Link Engine, we automatically globalize and affiliate all links on your WordPress site. 
1. **The Workflow:** Nothing changes for you once the plugin is installed. You can still add Amazon links for every page, just as you’ve done before. 
1. **The Results:** Each user gets sent to the correct item in their local store. This is an example of a user from the United Kingdom clicking your link. They’re sent to [amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk) with your proper UK Associates ID attached. 
1. **The Results:** Each user gets sent to the correct item in their local store. This is an example of a user from the United States clicking your link. They’re sent to [amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com) with your US Associates ID attached.
