Download the iTunes Link Engine to automatically localize and affiliate iTunes product links to improve user experience and increase conversions.

== Description ==

Turn every iTunes link across your site into an opportunity for worldwide sales by instantly converting all your links to the iTunes, App Store, iBooks, and Mac App Store, into intelligent globalized links. Whether you are promoting music, TV, movies, books or apps, within the iTunes ecosystem, the iLE is the easiest way to localize every link on your Wordpress site, so that it works across every iTunes Storefront.  This means that all clicks from your international audience are sent to the appropriate item in their own local storefront, improving conversions.

*Note:* You are not required to have a Geniuslink account to use this plugin. However, if you would like to earn affiliate commissions, you must sign up for a Geniuslink Account. [Try it out for free](http://social.geni.us/iLESignup) and check out pricing for the Geniuslink service on [our website](http://social.geni.us/PFCclG).

= How does the iTunes Link Engine plugin work? =

As soon as the plugin is installed and activated, your iTunes product links are instantly localized every time a user loads the page. You can even add new links to your WordPress site and each will be automatically converted without any additional work from you. Nothing else is needed on your part.

= How do I earn commissions from my links? =

To earn affiliate commissions, you first need to [create a Geniuslink account](http://social.geni.us/iLESignup), then connect it to your plugin with your API keys (detailed instructions can be found in the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/itunes-link-engine/faq/).  

Once signed up, add your PHG affiliate token to your Geniuslink Dashboard. Once your token has been added, the iTunes Link Engine will automatically add it to each link within your WordPress site. 

* *Note:* The iTunes Link Engine WordPress plugin is free to use. However, in order to earn affiliate commissions and take advantage of the in-depth reporting, **you must have a Geniuslink account**. By default, Geniuslink’s affiliate token will be used until you have connected your account, and added your own via the Geniuslink Dashboard.

= How is Geniuslink different? =

Most link “localization” plugins only translate a link for an international click when the same ADAM (Apple Digital Asset Management) ID exists in both storefronts.  However, due to many factors including Digital Rights licensing and the use of various distributors across different countries, the ADAM ID is not guaranteed to be the same. The iTunes Link Engine plugin uses Geniuslink’s [patented](https://www.google.com/patents/US8838767) five-step algorithm to find the metadata available from each product, and then match the product across storefronts. Our algorithm ensures that the user is sent to the most relevant product instead of sending your users to a non-existent item or an error message. 

In addition, connecting your Geniuslink account to the iTunes Link Engine gives you access to comprehensive reporting on clicks and commissions that no other plugin can offer. Geniuslink’s reports allow you to review performance metrics such as product types, click referrer, browser, device, operating system, geography, and more.


= Key Features: =

* **NEW!** Brand your globalized links with your own custom domain! (Note: this requires a paid [Geniuslink Account](http://social.geni.us/PFCclG))
* Pick which Geniuslink group this plugin syncs to. Set up the plugin on multiple WordPress sites and track clicks separately, or set up a specific group just for your WordPress site traffic. Instructions can be found under “How do I change the default group?” in the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/itunes-link-engine/faq/)
* Automatic localization and translation of all iTunes links based off a visitor’s location.
* Simple, easy to use interface.
* One time configuration. Simply install the plugin, set up your Geniuslink account, and connect the two with an API key.  We take care of the rest.
* No need to have access to the iTunes API or build links through the iTunes Link Builder in PHG. Just paste normal iTunes links anywhere on your site (even behind images).
* Your workflow remains the same.  No need to learn a new linking syntax, or disrupt your current flow.
* Automatically converts LinkShare, Tradedoubler, and DGM (Pro) formatted iTunes Affiliate links (from before the PHG rollout).

= What makes the iTunes Link Engine different from other Affiliate WP plugins? =
* Other plugins do not offer support for the new PHG affiliate program.
	* After iTunes made the switch to PHG in late 2013 and early 2014, similar plugins became obsolete.
* Unrivaled support from the Geniuslink team.
* No need to build links manually with a special link format. All of your links are automatically converted to localized links when the page loads.

Please note: By default, Geniuslink's affiliate token will be used until you have added your own via the Geniuslink dashboard.  Please [contact Geniuslink](mailto:hi@geni.us) if you have any questions.


= How do I affiliate my links? =

First, connect the plugin to your Geniuslink account (see "How do I get my API keys?"). Then, follow the steps below:

1. Add your PHG affiliate token to your Geniuslink dashboard.  Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](http://help.geni.us/support/solutions/articles/3000034945-adding-your-phg-affiliate-token-to-geniuslink).
*Note:* If you’ve already done this within your existing Geniuslink account, you do not need to add your token again.
1. You’re all set! You’ll start earning commissions from anything purchased from iTunes.

**Please Note:** If you are already using affiliated links on your website, they will NOT remain affiliated if you use the iTunes Link Engine Plugin.  In order to affiliate your links, you must [sign up for a Geniuslink account](http://social.geni.us/iLESignup) and add your affiliate token to the dashboard.  Once you have done this, and connected your account using the API keys, each of your links will be automatically affiliated.

= How do I change the default group? =
In order to change the group that the plugin syncs with, you must first connect your Geniuslink account using your API keys. Once you have done this, you can simply select the group you would like to use from the drop down menu under “Using Link Group” in the iTunes Link Engine Settings. If you leave this blank, the “Default” group in your Geniuslink Account will be used.

= Is the iTunes Link Engine compatible with other affiliate tools? =
* **Amazon Link Engine:**
The iTunes Link Engine is fully compatible with the Amazon Link Engine plugin. 

* **Skimlinks:**
The iTunes Link Engine plugin works perfectly with Skimlinks.

* **VigLink:**
The VigLink plugin, however, will overwrite the iLE and not allow your links to be globalized if it has already been installed. If you are currently using this plugin, you simply need to deactivate it from your Wordpress site, download and activate the iTunes Link Engine plugin, and then reactivate the Viglink plugin.  Once this is done, the plugins will work seamlessly together.

* **iTunes Widgets:**
The iTunes Widgets are unfortunately not compatible with this version of the iLE plugin.


== Screenshots ==

1. **iTunes Link Engine Interface.**
1. **Before:** You have links to an item within a single iTunes Storefront
1. **After:** When you install the iTunes Link Engine, we automatically globalize and affiliate all iTunes links on your WordPress site.
1. **The Workflow:** Nothing changes for you once the plugin is installed. You can still add iTunes links for every page, just as you’ve done before. 
1. **The Results:** Each user gets sent to the correct item in their local store. This is an example of a user from Germany clicking your link. They’re sent to [iTunes Germany](https://itunes.apple.com/de/album/id14920526?i=14920531) with your affiliate token attached.
1. **The Results:** Each user gets sent to the correct item in their local store. This is an example of a user from the United States clicking your link. They’re sent to [iTunes US](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/id46846?i=46803) with your affiliate token attached.
